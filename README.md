# Big Mountain Resort (Data Science Guided Capstone)

Welcome to the Big Mount Resort Data Science Guided Capstone! 

This repository contains my solution to Springboard's Data Science boot camp guided capstone project.

There six subunits. Each subunit focuses on a step of the Data Science Method:
1. Problem identification
2. Data wrangling
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Pre-processing and training data
5. Modelling
6. Documentation

## Pipenv

The `Pipefile` has all the python dependencies and requirements you should need. So you can use [Pipenv](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is you want to create a seperate python enviornment for this project.

To install pipenv see [here](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#install-pipenv-today).

To create the env and install the required libraries (once you have pipenv installed) you can just do:
```
pipenv install
```

Then to activate the env and launch jupyter from this env you can do something like the below two commands:
```
pipenv shell
jupyter lab
```
